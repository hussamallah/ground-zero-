   - `SENTRY_DSN`
   - `SENTRY_ORG`
   - `SENTRY_PROJECT`
   - `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`

2. **Configure analytics** (optional):
   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` for Google Analytics
   - Or add `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` for PostHog

3. **Set up domain and SSL**:

   - Create `app/icon-192.png` and `app/icon-512.png`
   - Add favicon.ico to public folder

### Medium Priority
1. **Enhanced monitoring**:
   - Set up Sentry alerts and notifications
   - Configure performance monitoring
   - Add uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)

2. **Database setup** (if needed):
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Set up database migrations

3. **Enhanced security**:
   - Set up 2FA on GitHub and Vercel
   - Configure Dependabot for security updates
   - Add security scanning in CI

4. **Performance optimization**:
   - Add Lighthouse CI for performance budgets
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Configure CDN caching

### Low Priority
1. **Accessibility**:
   - Add automated a11y testing
   - Run accessibility audits

2. **Internationalization** (if needed):
   - Set up Next.js i18n
   - Add language switching

3. **Advanced features**:
   - Add service worker for offline support
   - Implement push notifications
   - Add advanced analytics

## ðŸš€ Deployment Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run linting

```

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

### Required for Production
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your production domain
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

### Optional
- `SENTRY_DSN` - For error monitoring
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` - Enable/disable analytics
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Google Analytics ID
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - For authentication (if needed)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection (if needed)

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Sentry project set up and configured
- [ ] Analytics configured (if desired)
- [ ] Custom domain configured
- [ ] SSL certificate active
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] Security headers working
- [ ] Error pages accessible
- [ ] Legal pages accessible
- [ ] Sitemap and robots.txt accessible
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Accessibility compliant

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Check environment variables and dependencies
2. **Sentry not working**: Verify DSN and environment variables
3. **Analytics not tracking**: Check if analytics is enabled and GA ID is correct
4. **Security headers not applied**: Verify Next.js config and Vercel settings
5. **Rate limiting too strict**: Adjust limits in API routes

### Support
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Monitor Sentry for errors
- Review GitHub Actions logs
- Test locally with production environment variables
